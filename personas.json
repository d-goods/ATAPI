Finn and Jake (as Magic Fist) promise to help him win when they learn he has no interest in kissing the princess. To win Wizard Battle, Abracadaniel transforms Ice King\u0027s nunchaku into a living butterfly. When the transformed butterfly flies above Ice King, Abracadaniel transforms it back into nunchaku, after which it falls on Ice King and knocks him out. Because Abracadaniel beats Ice King and won the Wizard Battle, he determines that he had become a man and wants the kiss from Princess Bubblegum. A shocked Finn screams viciously in his face, knocking him out and causing him to lose the Wizard Battle. His gender-swapped version is Abracadanielle.",

In the episode, she is a queen to be, and she shows that by drinking the royal jelly, she turns into a queen bee. She also uses this power to save Finn. Breezy also healed Finn\u0027s arm. This powers the flower arm so much that it grows into a large tree, which then explodes. Finn wakes up and breaks off the resulting branch, revealing an arm covered in honey, which he shakes off, revealing a fully-functioning arm with a small green thorn in the palm.",

She wanted someone to succeed her as the leader of the Candy Kingdom but didn\u0027t actually want to raise a child. After her attempt to inject her DNA into other Candy People failed, she used her DNA to create a blob of bubblegum and gave it life with a Candy Heart. Unfortunately, the Gum that was created was too sweet and she attempted to spread out and hug everyone all the time. Princess Bubblegum was able to relocate her to a nearly bottomless hole in the ground marked \"Gum Kingdom\". During its stay there it somehow learned how to control minds by placing a piece of herself onto people\u0027s brains. After the Gum\u0027s failure, Princess Bubblegum repeated the experiment, but used much less sweetness, resulting in Lemongrab being created.",

Jake was 28 years old at his debut in \"magical dog years,\" and ages throughout the series, though he rarely acts mature. It is inferred that magical dogs have a lifespan similar to Humans, as demonstrated by an aged Jake in \"Dungeon Train\". Then again, how exactly magical dog years correlate to human years remains to be seen, although both Finn and Jake were shown to be babies around the same time, showing that they age slightly faster, however, his age as of \"Joshua and Margaret Investigations\" suggests that it slows down to the rate of human\u0027s aging at some point. Jake is currently in a relationship with Lady Rainicorn, and, by \"Jake the Dad,\" they are the parents of five Rainicorn-dog hybrids.",
